The “heart” dataset hosted on UCI contains approximately 270 observations, with 13 variables(which have been extracted from a larger set of 75). The goal is to predict whether or not this person has heart disease. Absence (1) or presence (2) of heart disease.
Attributes(13): 
1.	age. 
Numerical. Range from:29-77. 

2.	sex. Binary. 

3. chest pain type. 
   Categorical. Values from: 1,2,3,4.

4. resting blood pressure. 
   Numerical. Range from:94-200.

5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl.
   Numerical. Range from:125-564.

6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl. Binary.

7. resting electrocardiographic results. 
   Categorical. Values from: 0,1,2.

8. maximum heart rate achieved. 
   Numerical. Range from:71-202.

9. exercise induced angina. Binary.

10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    Numerical. Range from: 0.0-6.2.

11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment. 
    Categorical. Values from: 1,2,3. 

12. number of major vessels colored by flourosopy. 
    Numerical. Range from:0-3.

13. thal: 
Categorical. Values from: 3,6,7. 
3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable  defect.

dependent variable: Binary.1=absence. 2=presence.
